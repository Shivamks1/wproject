    <br>
    <p>1. Eat nuts <br>
            Despite being high in fat, nuts are incredibly nutritious and healthy.
            
            They’re loaded with magnesium, vitamin E, fiber, and various other nutrients (9).
            
            Studies demonstrate that nuts can help you lose weight and may help fight type 2 diabetes and heart disease (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).
            
            Additionally, your body doesn’t absorb 10–15% of the calories in nuts. Some evidence also suggests that this food can boost metabolism (13Trusted Source).
            
            In one study, almonds were shown to increase weight loss by 62%, compared with complex carbs (14Trusted Source).

            2. Eat fatty fish <br>
            Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat.
            
            This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients (22).
            
            Studies show that people who eat the most fish have a lower risk of several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and depression (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25).

            3. Eat fatty fish <br>
            Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat.
            
            This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients (22).
            
            Studies show that people who eat the most fish have a lower risk of several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and depression (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25).

            4. Get enough sleep<br>
            The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.
            
            Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).
            
            What's more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. One study linked insufficient sleep to an 89% and 55% increased risk of obesity in children and adults, respectively (30Trusted Source).

            5. Take care of your gut health with probiotics and fiber<br>
            The bacteria in your gut, collectively called the gut microbiota, are incredibly important for overall health.
            
            A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some of the world’s most serious chronic diseases, including obesity (31, 32Trusted Source).
            
            Good ways to improve gut health include eating probiotic foods like yogurt and sauerkraut, taking probiotic supplements, and eating plenty of fiber. Notably, fiber functions as fuel for your gut bacteria (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).
            <br><br>
            6. Drink some water, especially before meals<br>
            Drinking enough water can have numerous benefits.
            
            Surprisingly, it can boost the number of calories you burn.
            
            Two studies note that it can increase metabolism by 24–30% over 1–1.5 hours. This can amount to 96 additional calories burned if you drink 8.4 cups (2 liters) of water per day (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source).
            
            The optimal time to drink it is before meals. One study showed that downing 2.1 cups (500 ml) of water 30 minutes before each meal increased weight loss by 44% (37Trusted Source).
            <br><br>
            7. Take vitamin D3 if you don’t get much sun exposure <br>
            Sunlight is a great source of vitamin D.
            
            Yet, most people don’t get enough sun exposure.
            
            In fact, about 41.6% of the U.S. population is deficient in this critical vitamin (42Trusted Source).
            
            If you’re unable to get adequate sun exposure, vitamin D supplements are a good alternative.
            
            Their benefits include improved bone health, increased strength, reduced symptoms of depression, and a lower risk of cancer. Vitamin D may also help you live longer (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source).
            <br><br>
            8. Eat vegetables and fruits <br>
            Vegetables and fruits are loaded with prebiotic fiber, vitamins, minerals, and many antioxidants, some of which have potent biological effects.
            
            Studies show that people who eat the most vegetables and fruits live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other illnesses (50, 51).
            <br><br>
            9. Make sure to eat enough protein <br>
            Eating enough protein is vital for optimal health.
            
            What’s more, this nutrient is particularly important for weight loss (52Trusted Source).
            
            High protein intake can boost metabolism significantly while making you feel full enough to automatically eat fewer calories. It can also reduce cravings and your desire to snack late at night (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).
            
            Sufficient protein intake has also been shown to lower blood sugar and blood pressure levels (57Trusted Source, 58Trusted Source).
            <br><br>
            10. Do some cardio <br>
            Doing aerobic exercise, also called cardio, is one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health.
            
            It’s particularly effective at reducing belly fat, the harmful type of fat that builds up around your organs. Reduced belly fat should lead to major improvements in metabolic health (59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).
