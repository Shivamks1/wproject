    <h1> What not to do</h1>
    <p> 1. Don’t drink sugar calories <br>
            Sugary drinks are among the most fattening items you can put into your body.
            
            This is because your brain doesn’t measure calories from liquid sugar the same way it does for solid food (1Trusted Source).
            
            Therefore, when you drink soda, you end up eating more total calories (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
            
            Sugary drinks are strongly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).
            
            Keep in mind that certain fruit juices may be almost as bad as soda in this regard, as they sometimes contain just as much sugar. Their small amounts of antioxidants do not negate the sugar’s harmful effects (8Trusted Source).
            Avoid processed junk food (eat real food instead)
            Processed junk food is incredibly unhealthy.
            
            These foods have been engineered to trigger your pleasure centers, so they trick your brain into overeating — even promoting food addiction in some people (15Trusted Source).
            
            They’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients but high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugar and refined grains. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.

            2. Don’t fear coffee <br>
            Coffee is very healthy.
            
            It’s high in antioxidants, and studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19, 20, 21Trusted Source).

            3. Don’t overcook or burn your meat <br>
            Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It’s very high in protein and contains various important nutrients.
            
            However, problems occur when meat is overcooked or burnt. This can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that raise your risk of cancer (38Trusted Source).
            
            When you cook meat, make sure not to overcook or burn it.

            4. Avoid bright lights before sleep <br>
            When you’re exposed to bright lights in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin (39Trusted Source, 40Trusted Source).
            
            One strategy is to use a pair of amber-tinted glasses that block blue light from entering your eyes in the evening.
            
            This allows melatonin to be produced as if it were completely dark, helping you sleep better (41Trusted Source).

            5. Don’t smoke or do drugs, and only drink in moderation<br>
            If you smoke or abuse drugs, tackle those problems first. Diet and exercise can wait.
            
            If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation and consider avoiding it completely if you tend to drink too much.
            <br><br>
            6. Don’t eat a lot of refined carbs<br>
            Not all carbs are created equal.
            
            Refined carbs have been highly processed to remove their fiber. They’re relatively low in nutrients and can harm your health when eaten in excess.
            
            Studies show that refined carbs are linked to overeating and numerous metabolic diseases (73Trusted Source, 74, 75Trusted Source, 76Trusted Source, 77).
            <br><br>
            7. Don’t fear saturated fat<br>
            Saturated fat has been controversial.
            
            While it’s true that saturated fat raises cholesterol levels, it also raises HDL (good) cholesterol and shrinks your LDL (bad) particles, which is linked to a lower risk of heart disease (78Trusted Source, 79Trusted Source, 80Trusted Source, 81Trusted Source).
            
            New studies in hundreds of thousands of people have questioned the association between saturated fat intake and heart disease (82Trusted Source, 83Trusted Source).
            <br><br>
            8. Avoid artificial trans fats<br>
            Artificial trans fats are harmful, man-made fats that are strongly linked to inflammation and heart disease (86Trusted Source, 87Trusted Source, 88Trusted Source, 89).
            
            While trans fats have been largely banned in the United States and elsewhere, the U.S. ban hasn’t gone fully into effect — and some foods still contain them.
            <br><br>
            9. Don’t go on a diet<br>
            Diets are notoriously ineffective and rarely work well in the long term.
            
            In fact, dieting is one of the strongest predictors for future weight gain (104Trusted Source).
            
            Instead of going on a diet, try adopting a healthier lifestyle. Focus on nourishing your body instead of depriving it.
            
            Weight loss should follow as you transition to whole, nutritious foods.
